# Guitar Shop React

This is a React application for a guitar shop, built with Vite. It uses GraphQL to fetch data from a server.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation
1. Create a folder on your PC
   ```
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Redoniii/PabauTask1.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory
   ```sh
   cd PabauTask1
   ```
4. Change to "Submission" branch
   ```sh
   git checkout Submission
   ```   
5. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the app in development mode, run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (the port might be different, check your terminal) to view it in the browser.

I also deployed the project to see what it looks like: http://musicguitar.netlify.app

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in the development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code using ESLint.
- `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for preview.
